\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Type Ia supernovae(\sne) are transient astronomical events resulting from a powerful and luminous explosion of a white dwarf. They are identified by their brightness evolution, with a luminosity peak about 15 days after explosion, and a slow decrease lasting up to few months. \sne~can be used as standard candles to determine cosmological distances. They are included in a Hubble diagram, one is the most statistically efficient approach to constraint the Dark Energy equation of state (\citealt{Betoule_2014,Scolnic_2018}).
\par
The stated ambition of the LSST Supernovae program is to maximize the sample size of well-measured type Ia supernovae while reducing systematic uncertainties on cosmological parameters. Increasing the statistics in the Hubble diagram requires (1) advances in the measurement of the distances (i.e.  a control at the per-mil level of the photometry and survey flux calibration, and a progress in standardization technique) (2) a better control of the astrophysical environment and its potential impacts on the SN light curves and distances (local host properties, absorption) (3) a better control of the SN diversity (SN~Ia sub-populations, population drift with redshift) (4) a precise determination of the survey selection function (SN identification, residual contamination by non-SN~Ia's as a function of redshift).
\par
 The ten-year Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image billions of objects in six colors. 80 to 90\per of the observing time will be dedicated to Wide Fast Deep(WFD) primary survey, which will cover half of the sky ($\sim$ 18000 \degsq) at a ''universal'' cadence. The remaining observing time will be shared among other programs (mini-surveys) including intensive scanning of a set of Deep Drilling (DD) fields. It is expected that about 10\per (100\per) of \sne~observed in the WFD (DD) survey will be identified from spectral features. Accurate supernova parameters will be estimated from well-measured light curves characterized by a sampling of few days and high Signal-to-Noise Ratio per band (\snrb).  As a consequence all the studies presented in this paper rely on the supernova light curves only.  Obtaining high quality light curves is therefore a key design point of the SN survey:  the average quality of the light curves depends primarily on the observing strategy.
\par
In a recent paper (ref), the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) has presented an analysis of the WFD survey of observing strategies simulated by the project\footnote{These strategies are available here: }. We have concluded that an unprecedented number of high quality \sne~will be observed in the WFD survey (between 120k and 170k) up to redshifts $z~$0.3. The DD SN programm is necessary for obtaining a sample of high-redshift (up to $z\simeq$1) and well-measured supernovae which improves cosmological constraints from SNIa. Achieving Stage IV dark energy goals will critically rely on the deep drilling fields (DDFs) of LSST.
\par
This paper compiles a set of studies related to the DD program of LSST. The main goal is to assess whether observing \sne~up to $z\simeq$1 is achievable while respecting design constraints (number of fields, budget,...). This article is subdivided into 6 sections. The design constraints of the DD program and the metrics used to assess observing strategies are described in the first two parts. A detailed analysis of the recent DD surveys proposed by the project is presented in the third section. A method to optimize the DD program is proposed in a fourth part. The last section of the document is dedicated to the presentation of DD realistic scenarios that would achieve the goal of observing high quality \sne~up to   $z\simeq$1.

\section{Deep Drilling survey design constraints}
\label{sec:design}

\section{Metrics to assess observing strategies}
\label{sec:metrics}
The metrics used to assess observing strategies are estimated from full simulation of light curves. We have used the SALT2 model (\citealt{Guy_2007,Guy_2010}) where a \sne~is described by five parameters: \snx, the normalization of the SED sequence; \snstretch, the stretch; \sncolor, the color; \daymax, the day of maximum luninosity; and $z$, the redshift. a flat-$\Lambda$CDM model was used to estimate cosmological distances, with $H_0$ = 70 km s$^{-1}$, $\Omega_m$ = 0.3 and $\Omega_\Lambda$ = 0.7.
\par
We rely on two metrics to assess observing strategies: the redshift limit \zlim, and the number of well-measured \sne, \nsn. A well-measured \sne~is defined by the following selection criteria: light curves points with $SNR\geq$ 1; at least four (ten) LC points before (after) maximum luminosity; at least one point with a phase lower than -10 and higher than 20; \sigc$\leq$0.04 where \sigc~ is the error on the color parameter of the supernova (this corresponds to \sigmu$\leq$0.12 where \sigmu~is the distance modulus error). The redshift limit is defined as the maximum redshift of supernovae passing these selection criteria. The redshift of the complete sample, \zcomp, is the redshift limit of a faint supernova defined by \xcfaint. 



\section{Analysis of current simulations}
\label{sec:analysis}

\section{Towards an optimization of the DD survey}
\label{sec:opti}
\subsection{Optimization method}
The analysis of the most recent simulations have shown (see \ref{sec:analysis}) that it was difficult, with the proposed cadences of observation, filter allocation and season lengths, to collect complete samples of \sne~with redshift higher than \zcompb\seq 0.55-0.6 for a DD budget of \seq 5\per.  A high budget (\seq 13.5\per) is requested to reach \zcompb\seq 0.65. These redshift limits are well below the ambitious goal of \zcompb\seq1. But we do not know, at this stage, whether this goal is achievable while respecting the design requirements (sec. \ref{sec:design}). We propose in the following a method to adress this question.\par
The value of the DD budget depends primarily on 4 parameters: the number of fields to observe, the season length (per field and per season), the cadence of observation (per field and per season), and the number of visits \nvisits~per observing night, the sum of the visits per filter \nvisitsb. \nvisitsb~affect the flux measurement uncertainties and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio per filter \snrb~of the light curves defined by:
\begin{equation}
  SNR^b &=& \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n^b}{\left({{f_i^b}\over{\sigma_i^b}}\right)^2}}
  \label{eq:opt1}
\end{equation}
where $f^b$, and $\sigma^b$ are the fluxes and fluxes uncertainties. The summation runs over the number of light curve points. In the background-dominated regime one has $\sigma_i^b \simeq \sigma_5^b$ where $\sigma_5^b$ is equal by definition to
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_5^b &=& {{f_5^b}\over{5}}
\end{equation}
where $f_ 5^b$ is the five-sigma flux related to the five-sigma depth magnitude $m_5^b$ through:
\begin{equation}
  m_5^b &=& -2.5 \log f_5^b+zp^b
\end{equation}
where $zp^b$ is the zero point of the considered filter.  $m_5^b$ is related to \nvisitsb through:
\begin{equation}
  m_5^b - m_5^{b, single visit} & = & 1.25 \log(N_{visits}^b)
  \label{eq:opt4}
\end{equation}
where $m_5^{b, single visit}$ is the five-sigma depth corresponding to a single visit, a parameter depending on observing conditions. These equations \eqref{eq:opt1,eq:opt4} describe the relationship between \snrb~ and \nvisitsb.
\\



These results raise two questions related to the LSST DD survey: what are the prerequesites to reach \zcompb\seq1? For a given set of observing strategy parameters (i.e. number of fields, season length, cadence of observation), what is the estimated budget

\section{Type Ia supernovae as probe for assessing observing strategy}
\label{sec:snprobes}
Type Ia supernovae are transient astronomical events resulting from a powerful and luminous explosion of a white dwarf. They are identified by their brightness evolution, with a luminosity peak about 15 days after explosion, and a slow decrease lasting up to few months. It is expected that all type Ia supernovae observed in the DD fields in LSST will be identified from spectral features. Accurate supernova parameters will be estimated from well-measured light curves characterized by a sampling of few days and high Signal-to-Noise Ratio per band (\snrb). These two quality criteria are determined at the first order by two key parameters of observing strategies: the cadence of observation, and the number of visits per band.
\par
Rest-frame wavelengths of type Ia supernovae range from $\sim$380 nm (blue cut-off) to $\sim$800 nm (red cut-off). Since the flux fraction per band (observer frame) varies with the redshift, these two limits have an impact on the possible list of bands with minimal flux useable to observe supernovae (Tab. \ref{tab:zfilters}): only three bands (\bi\bz\by) are useable in the redshift range 0.64-0.98 and only two (\bz\by) for redshifts higher than $\sim$1. 

\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \caption{Available bands with minimal flux vs redshift.}\label{tab:zfilters}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
      \hline
      \hline
      Redshift range & available bands \\
      \hline
      0.01-0.1 & \bg\br\bi\\
      0.1-0.3 & \bg\br\bi\bz \\
      0.3-0.64 & \br\bi\bz\by \\
      0.64-0.98 & \bi\bz\by \\
      $\geq$ 0.98 & \bz\by \\
      \hline
      \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Type Ia supernovae may be described by five parameters (\salt~model): stretch\strech, color \col, time of maximum luminosity \daymax, normalization of the SED \xnorm, and the redshift \z.  They are measured from light curve fits to estimate the Hubble diagram distance modulus:
\begin{equation}
  \mu =m_B^*- M_B+\alpha \times x_1 -\beta \times c \label{eq:mu}
\end{equation}
where $m_B^*$ corresponds to the observed peak magnitude in rest-frame B-band and $\alpha$($\simeq$ 0.14),$\beta$($\simeq$ 3.1) and $M_B$ are nuisance parameters. The distance modulus error \sigmu~is dominated by the error on the color \sigc: measuring $\mu$ at the precent level  requires to have \sigc$\lesssim$0.04.

Since \sigc~varies with the redshift  (Fig. \ref{fig:sigc_z}, top), the requirement \sigc$\lesssim$0.04 leads to a redshift limit value (0.61 in \ref{fig:sigc_z}, top) defining the limit of the completeness of the survey (\zlim) if \sigc~is estimated using faint type Ia supernovae with (\strech,\col)=(-2.0,0.2). One may also observe (\ref{fig:sigc_z}, bottom) that \sigc~also depends (as expected) on \snrb. This means that the condition \sigc$\lesssim$0.04 requires \snrb$\geq$\snrbmin, where \snrbmin~is a minimal signal-to-noise ratio for each of the bands available in the redshift range considered (Tab. \ref{tab:zfilters}).

\section{LSST Deep Drilling program design constraints}
\label{sec:design}

Up to approximately 10\% of LSST observing time will be dedicated to other programs, including intensive observation of a set of Deep Drilling Fields. 

\begin{itemize}
\item number of fields: the location of four DD fields (\cosmos,\elais,\xmm,\cdfs) are already fixed (Tab. \ref{tab:locddf}). Two could be added in the south region (\adfa,\adfb) to ensure a synergy with \euclid~and \wfirst~surveys, at the begining and at the end of the LSST survey, respectively. 
\item season length: the number of exploding supernovae is proportional to the season duration. Season lengths of at least 6 months are required to maximize the size of the sample of observed type Ia supernovae.
\item cadence: observations every $\sim$3 days would lead to an adequate sampling of the light curves. 
\item DD budget: it is expected that 5-6$\%$ of the total number of LSST visits will be alloted to the DD program and shared among science topics interested by DD observations (such as AGN, supernovae, ...).  This limited budget is related to the total number of visits per observing night through the relation:
  \begin{eqnarray}
  DD_{budget} &=& N_{visits}^{DD}/N_{visits}^{tot} \\
  N_{visits}^{DD} &=& \sum_{i=1}^{N_{fields}} \sum_{ j=1}^{N_{season}^i} N_{visits,night}^{ij}\times SL^{ij}\times 30/Cad^{ij} 
  \end{eqnarray}
where $N_{fields}$ is the number of DD fields, $N_{season}$ the number of season of observations per field, $SL$ the season length, $Cad$ the cadence of observations, and $N_{visits, night}$ the total number of visits per observation night. $N_{visits,night}$ has been estimated for a cadence of 3 days, season lengths of 6 months, and $N_{visits}^{tot$}$ = (Tab. \ref{tab:ddbudget}). $N_{visits,night}$ largely depends on the observing strategy:
